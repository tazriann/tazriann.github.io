  <p> &#x1F600; &#x1F44B; <strong> Hi, Tazrian Noor here. Sincerely welcome to my personal page, which I hope will give you a full understanding of my experience and abilities. </strong></p>

  <p> I received my B.Sc degree in Electrical and Engineering Degree from <a href="https://http://www.eee.iub.edu.bd/">Independent University, Bangladesh</a> with a minor in Electronics and Telecomunication Engineering in Autumn 2023. </p>

  <p> I was always curious how things work and liked delving deeper. During my third year of Bachelor's degree, I joined IUB-Photonics Simulation Lab (IUBPSL) as an undergraduate student researcher. I, along with lab members, studied unique structures to optimize Silicon and Cadmium Telluride thin film solar cells using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method.</p> 

  <p> Please contact me with any questions you have about me personally or would like to discuss: <a href="tazriannoor02@gmail.com">tazriannoor02@gmail.com</a>. </p>
